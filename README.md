# Idea
This is a game where you are part of a community and your job is to sow, care for, and harvest wheat which can then be turned into bread. In the future, I would like to have other roles that would be important to a small community, and have some sort of risk involved with not completing your assigned tasks in the village. Also needs to be activities that can be done in your free time. Maybe you have to gather enough because you have to give some to a king that claims ownership over your land and if you don't have enough he'll torch the village.


# Getting Started

1. install node
2. clone repo
3. open terminal window in project directory and run `npm i`
5. get assets from {TO DO}
4. once packages have installed, run `npm run serve` and it will start the webservers

# To Do
1. implement Electron
2. resize canvas with viewport
