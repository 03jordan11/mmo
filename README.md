# Idea
This is a game where you are part of a community and your job is to sow, care for, and harvest wheat which can then be turned into bread. In the future, I would like to have other roles that would be important to a small community, and have some sort of risk involved with not completing your assigned tasks in the village. Also needs to be activities that can be done in your free time. Maybe you have to gather enough because you have to give some to a king that claims ownership over your land and if you don't have enough he'll torch the village.

Maybe another role where all you do is chop down trees, process it into firewood, and use it to fuel a steam generator that produces electricity and fills up batteries that you have to give to your human overlords. Oh yeah, the king is actually just a human and it turns out you are a bunch of robots doing jobs for humans, and the better you do the more 'skillpoints' you get to unlock different abilities maybe?
